### What is EXIF data?

Exchange Image File Format or EXIF data is typically comprised of a range of settings such as ISO speed, shutter speed, aperture, white balance, camera model and make, date and time, lens type, focal length and much more. Nowadays, every modern digital camera has the capability to record this information, along with many other camera settings, right into the photographs.

Since I have been clicking my camera shutter a lot these days, so I need a simple application for me to easily read my photograph EXIF data. Then, I just created one called Heiswayi Nrird Exif Reader in C# WPF, a simple tool to easily extract the EXIF data from an image file.
