I have been using [Termie](http://termie.sourceforge.net/) for some time ago, as far I can remember during my university days. It's a simple RS232 terminal program, originally developed by David McClurg in 2008. Termie is a clone of [Termite from ITB CompuPhase](http://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm). It is a useful program to monitor a serial port connection or log an output data from a RS232 communication device.

So, I forked the project and give a little _touch up_ to Termie's original source code. I make some enhancements to it as the project development has stopped and no update since May 2008. Thus, I called it "Termie2".
