In cryptography, a cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption of information into some kind of secret codes. For a substitution cipher, it's a method of encoding characters of plaintext into something called ciphertext. There are few popular cipher algorithms such as steganography, ROT13, Caesar shift cipher, Vigenere, etc. which I can use.
There are also the modern unbreakable of encryption algorithms available such as Triple DES, RSA, Blowfish, Twofish, AES, etc.

But to be epic, I decided to use a substitution method with my own designed keys and encoding algorithm. So, I created my own cipher application in C# WPF known as _Heiswayi Nrird Cipher Program_. It's just for fun and educational purpose only, nothing more.
