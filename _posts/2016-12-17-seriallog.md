SerialLog is a simple console application I created to log any serial data received from a serial port. The only purpose is just to read incoming data from a serial communication and log the data into a log file. My intention of creating this simple program is for collecting a sample of data received from a client's PC serial port before I can proceed with a real application development that featured reading/writing data via a serial communication.
