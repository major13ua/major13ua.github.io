Directory Crawler is a lightweight console application built in .NET C# to crawl and list out all accessible directories and sub-directories within an assigned target directory, then output the result of directory list into a text file.

I created this program as I need to monitor some shared directories within a network.

### Screenshot

Here's how the program looked like and works, in animated GIF:

After the program finished running, an output text file will be created within the program base folder and if you open the text file, this is how it looked like; a list of accessible directories within the assigned target directory.

_Note: Creating an output file sometimes might be time-consuming depending on PC performance and number of crawled directories (usually more than 1000+ directories)._

Example (opened using Notepad2-mod app):
