Asynchronous PowerShell Scripter is a .NET C# WPF-version application for executing PowerShell script asynchronously with few following interesting features;-

- save new or remove PowerShell preset scripts
- import PowerShell script file directly
- drag-n-drop PowerShell script file onto Script Editor
- export selected lines or all lines output into a text file.

### Preset Scripts

Preset scripts are saved in the plain text file format in `presets` folder where the title of the script is the filename of the text file itself. This makes thing easier to manually modify the script or to add a batch of scripts WITHOUT needing to run the application. It's more manageable, easy to backup or synchronize with the cloud service.
