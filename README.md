## About this Jekyll theme

This repo contains the source code of my site (referred to SITE_URL), which is built from scratch with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and generously hosted automatically on GitHub with free (Thanks, GitHub Pages!). This Jekyll theme is using [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for the awesome icons and [Fira](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) fonts by Mozilla for the awesome typeface.
